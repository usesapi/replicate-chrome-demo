# Sapi
This project uses [Sapi](https://usesapi.com) to allow using the replicate API without developing a backend. To learn more, visit the full tutorial at: https://sapi.gitbook.io/replicate.com-apps-tutorials/chrome-extension-create-disney-character-from-any-face-on-the-web

# How To Use

## Prerequisites

Node.js and npm (comes with Node) installed on your machine. We recommend to use [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

## Cloning the app

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the app.\
Run the command `git clone git@github.com:usesapi/replicate-chrome-demo.git`

## Get Replicate API Token
Sign in to your replicate account, open the [Account](https://replicate.com/account) page and copy your API Token.

## Configure your Sapi Proxy

Sign in to [Sapi](https://console.usesapi.com), create a new Replicate Sapi and configure it with the Replicate API Token.\
Configure your Replicate Sapi ID in the top of `src/sapi.ts`
```
const SAPI_ID = "api-replicate-com-....";
```

npm install
```
